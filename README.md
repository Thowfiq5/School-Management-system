# School Management System

This is a School Management System built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1.  Initialize Git (if not already done):
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
2.  Push to GitHub.
3.  Import the project in Vercel.
    -   **Root Directory**: Leave empty (unless you put this inside a subfolder).
    -   **Build Command**: None (it's a static site).
    -   **Output Directory**: None.

## Troubleshooting

If the UI is not loading:
1.  Ensure the `css`, `js`, and `assets` folders are uploaded to GitHub.
2.  Check for case-sensitivity issues (e.g., `css` folder named `CSS`).
